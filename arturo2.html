	<h1><b>Huzzah! You have the kill!</b></h1>
	</div>
	<p> You spot the deer through the bushes, gently creeping as your party waits behind you. You aim the shot, the arrow softly wooshing through the air
		before landing the shot square between the eyes. The mighty buck falls down to the sound of cheers behind you and ale pours from flasks.</p>
		
		<p> As a reward for the kill, your uncle offers you his prize steed. A magnificant beast with a coat of shiny black and dappled white spots - but 
		the horse is known to be unruly and untamable to all riders except from your uncle.</p>
		
		<p> Will you chose to accept the horse?</p>
