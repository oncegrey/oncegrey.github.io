<p>Faralindne's return is met by thousands of cheering elves - people have come from all over to witness a hero that is one of their own kind, something so rarely seen and celebrated even less.</p>

<p> Faralinde spends her days helping her people and raising her family far from the slums they once lived with the gold she earned. She uses her new found respect from humans to enact change amoung the elven community and find a fairer ground for them to stand on.</p>

<p>The changes are small and slow, but all change needs to start somewhere.</p>
