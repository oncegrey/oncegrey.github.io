	<h1><b>A Strange encounter.</b></h1>
	</div>
	<p>You celebrate the feast with your friends and drinks never seem to run dry. You drink until you can hardly walk and then in your drunken state, decide to continue hunting in the
		woods. You find yourself armed with a wooden sword off on a bear hunt - much to your friends protests. In your drunken state, you trip and hit your head
			fading into darkness</p>
	
		<p> You awake to a man hovering above you, probing you awake with a stick. He has heard of your great skill in the training yard and offers you a quest
		- slay the dragon terrosing the Kingdom and earn a handsome reward.</p>
		
		<p> You carefully consider the offer, if you were successful on your quest it would mean that you would be a hero and able to save your family's reputation -
			allowing trade to start again and your family to once again rise in status to what they were before your sister ran off - maybe even be able to raise yourself even 
		higher in status than you were before. But on the other hand, if you were unsuccessful, you'd die a horrible and painful death.</p>
		
		<p>Do you accept?</p>
	<div class="overlay" id="overlay" onclick="off()">
		<div class="text">After denying the quest, you achieve nothing of greatness. You and your brothers all fail to secure good marriages due to your family's poor reputation
			and eventually your family loses their estate, forcing them down the social ladder to farmers. While travelling to your family's new, lesser home, the dragon spots you - 
			it's fiery breath is the last thing you ever see.</div>
