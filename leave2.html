	<p>At the summit of Nokorich mountain, you find the dragon. A mighty beast that throws it's head back and roars as it sees you approach. 
	You see two optionsfor the battle, either attack head on or hide behind the rocks and strike the soft flesh behind the dragon's wings when it turns it's back.</p>

		<div class="text">The dragon spots you running towards him, sword held high as you charge forward. It opens it's mouth, cheeks flaring red as it unleshes its 
			flames upon you. At least you go out in a blaze of glory. </p>
