	<h1><b>Welcome to the Sterling family!</b></h1>
	</div>
	<p> The few noble families that are still your friends come to your estate for the hunt - the servants have been preparing for days to make sure everything is in order. This is an annual tradition for the 
		Sterling family and this year you've beeen chosen to act as head of the family for the hunt in your fathers absence.</p>
			<p>You've chosen to let your oldest younger brothers accompany the hunting party 
		so that they can finally see some action. You saddle the horses and prepare the hounds - the last thing to do is to pick your weapon for the hunt. Your father's sword lies on one side of the room, freshly sharpened with jewels adoring the handle. 
		On the other side is your uncle's bow, varnished maple wood with deer carvings in the wood, pheasant feathered arrows lie inside the matching leather quiver.</p>
	<p>Will you take a sword or a bow on your hunt?</p>
	
	<div class="overlay" id="overlay" onclick="off()">
		<div class="text">You pick the sword for your weapon and the fine craftsman ship has never let down your father. You try to use it to sneak upon the deer
	 - but your brother is quicker! His keen aim places an arrow in the middle of the creature's eyes, giving him the glory of the kill.</div>
