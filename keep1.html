		<h1><b>The Weapon Cart</b></h1>
		</div>
	<p>You end up being grateful for your choice to keep the bandits with you! They are a funny bunch of men lead by a grumpy dwarf. You fears about supplies running out fade as they keep supplies flowing, much to your suprise 
	and make the journey seem lighter with their banter. As you reach then end of the forest, you find an overturned merchantsâ€™ chart with weaponry much finer than your own. </p>
	<p>Do you raid the cart, or do you leave the scene be? <p>

		<div class="text">Your sword is good and strong, but the bandit's weaponry is not as fine as your own. You do some damage to the dragon, but not enough
			and soon you and your party are too fatigued to keep up the fight. Mistakes are made - and the dragon takes you down.</p>
