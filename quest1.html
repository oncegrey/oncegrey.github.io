		<h1><b>The Journey Begins</b></h1>
		</div>
	<p>Your sleep is restless the night before you leave, wondering if what you're doing is truly a good idea. You wake up with the morning light and carefully pack 
		supplies for your journey. You decide to travel light and pack just enough for the five day journey it'll take you to get to the dragon's liar, at the peak of 
		Nokorich mountain. You sneak out from your home, not wanting to tell your family in fear that they'd stop you - and start your quest. </p>
		
		<p> You know of two ways to get to Nokorich, there is the path that runs through Terreling Forest, bandit ridden but a shorter route or the other way you can go runs 
		by The Yearning Ocean, wide open but a longer journey. </p>
	
		
		<p>Do you take the ocean or forest path?</p>
	<div class="overlay" id="overlay" onclick="off()">
		<div class="text">The ocean path seemed the safer route â€“ but alas you were wrong and find 
							yourself surrounded by a pack of wolves, chased from Nokorich Mountain to the ocean paths by the dragon's terror. They are too much to handle and you die fighting. </p>
