<h1><b>Welcome to the Kingdom of Freywyn!</b></h1>

</div>
<p>The kingdom of Freywyn is an ancient place, where elves and dwarfs dwell and magic hangs in the air. 
Your race can define you – humans reign the kingdom, where wealth and status are the most important things you can have. 
On the other hand, elves face the opposite problem - traded as slaves for 500 years, the elves have a major distrust of humans and since 
their liberation 60 years ago now fill up the slums of the city, uneducated and surviving on rations they make up their diet 
with what food they can catch with their bare hands and shoddy tools. But distrust hangs in the air as black-market slaves 
still exists which means that no elf can ever feel truly safe, causing unrest in the land. In this kingdom, so very fast, 
two young lives stand on the precipice of change.  </p>

<div id="Demo1" class="w3-hide w3-container">
  <p>Arturo Sterling comes from one of the wealthiest families of the nobility and is heir to the family legacy. The Sterling family own several plots of land within the Kingdom in Freywyn and are known to be kind and fair. Yet there hangs a dark cloud – Arturo’s sister has broken an engagement with the Usdan family and ran off with a stable hand instead. The Usdan family are big suppliers and have cut off their trade with the Sterling’s -causing their allies to follow suit. With their reputation in ruin, their workers grow restless as less and less people trade with the Sterling family and funds are running low – the dragon destroying farmlands also doesn’t seem to be helping the supply chain either. If only there was some way for their reputation to be saved…</p>

<button onClick="myFunction('Demo2')" class="w3-button w3-block w3-light-green w3-left-align">Faralinde Levitas - an elf from the city slums</button>
<div id="Demo2" class="w3-hide w3-container">

  <p>Faralinde Levitas is a young elven girl just trying to provide for her large family. The oldest of 7 siblings and a sharp shot, she takes it upon herself to hunt in the woods to provide for her family as rations do not stretch fair enough for a family of 9 – so she provides was little extras she can, but hunting is getting harder and harder these days with the dragon burning the forest and making the animals flee. Faralinde’s biggest dream is to raise her family out of poverty and finally have enough food so that everyone has a full belly.</p>
