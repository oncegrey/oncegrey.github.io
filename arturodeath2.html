	<p> Arturo's death does not come as a surpise to those who knew him. There is a short lived glory about the boy who died on a quest to kill the best terrorising the locals which
	in turn allows his family some trade power once more, but people are quick to forget his efforts and the memory of his sister's betrayal lingers.</p>
	
	<p> After all, she succeded in her quest.</p>
