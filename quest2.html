		<h1><b>Terreling Forest</b></h1>
		</div>
	<p>The road is perilous, and you are jumped by bandits. But you have a quick wit and a sharp tongue – you offer the bandits some of the reward if they help 
			you slay the dragon. They accept and you have now gathered a small party to help you on your quest  </p>
		
		<p> You find your path through the forest longer and more tiresome than you expected – with the bandits sometimes slowing you down - with just enough supplies to get you to
			the dragon's liar, you fear they'll run out before you get there.</p>
<p>			Do you keep your friends or decide to brave the last part of your journey on your own?  </p>
