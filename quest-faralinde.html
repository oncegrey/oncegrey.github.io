		<h1><b>A Strange encounter.</b></h1>
		</div>
	<p>The small space and crowds of people soon prove too much for you and as much as you love your family, you decide to go for a walk to clear your head before
	you need to go back into the stuffy appartment to sleep. You stroll through the woods, a strong wind pulling at your clothes - you consider heading back as its
	windier thna you'd thought it'd be and consider heading back. Before you can decide you hear a crack above your head and the last thing you see when you look up is 
	a branch falling towards your head. </p>
	
	<p> DYou awake to a man hovering above you, probing you awake with a stick. He has seen your great aim when you've been hunting in the woods and offers you a quest
		- slay the dragon terrosing the Kingdom and earn a handsome reward. </p>
	
	<p> You carefully consider the offer, if you were successful on your quest it would mean that you would be a hero and able to make some change to the elven community-
	maybe an elven hero could change a lot of things and start to make a difference for them. The most tempting fact is that the reward would mean that you could help 
	your family - hopefully get a house big enough so that everyone can sleep comfortably instead of piling on top of each other. But failure would mean a painful death,
	and then who would feed your family?</p>
		
	
		
		<p>Do you accept?</p>
	<div class="overlay" id="overlay" onclick="off()">
		<div class="text">After denying the quest, you achieve nothing of greatness. You and you're family live on in the one bedroom house in the city slums, no one 
		ever going anywhere else due to lack of funds. As much as you hate it, you know you're fate will be tied to a marriage and starving kids in the same slum - 
		just like you're parents. </p>
