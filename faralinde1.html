	<p>It's closing in on dinner time, your siblings look to you eagarly as you put on your hunting jacket and sling your bow over your shoulder - it was time 
		to go catch dinner, rations never went very far. </p>
	<p> You carefully tread through the woods and find yourself spotting two very distinct tracks. One to the east, the careful hops of a rabbit disappearing into the bushes. 
	The other, to the north, is the deeper treads of a buck, leading off into the woods.</p>
	
	<p>Will you go the North or the east?</p>
	<div class="overlay" id="overlay" onclick="off()">

		your shot and go home with slim pickings for your family.</div>
