		<h1><b>The Weapon Cart</b></h1>
		</div>
	<p>You sneak away in the dead of night, careful not to wake your companions incase you need to face their wrath - you don't think they'd take kindly to
missing out on their reward. You manage to make your way out of the forest and find yourself faced with a useful situation - an abandoned weapons cart.	</p>

<p> The cart is charred but most of the weapons seem to still be useful. A sword and a well crafted bow catch your eye and seem to be the least damaged of the bunch.
You decide to take one of them, to better equip you for the challenge ahead.</p>
		
	
<p>What weapon do you chose?</p>

			You perish in the dragon's firey breath. </p>
