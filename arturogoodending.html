<p>Arturo returns home to his village triumphant! Once again restoring his family's place in the trade market and saving them from ruin. Bards are sung for miles about the strong young man who saved Freywyn from the fearsome dragon that was destroying their lands.</p>

<p>Arturo spends the rest of his days being a hero amoung men, helping out wherever he can and becoming a household name to many. After his death a great many years later, a statue is errected in his honour, the enscription reads <i>A hero is born among a hundred, a wise man is found among a thousand, but an accomplished one might not be found even among a hundred thousand men.</i></p>
