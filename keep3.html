		<h1><b>The Hero rises</b></h1>
		</div>
	<p>You make it to the top of the mountain where the dragon lies, hugging the side to make sure that you don’t get blown off. 
	It’s a hard fight but you bandit comrades keep you company and lend their hand where they can. </p>
		
	<p> You and the bandits celebrate with drinks in the woods, knowing that there would be more celebrations when news spreads of the dragon's demise, 
	Strangely, the man who gave you the quest turns up and you see him hiding between the trees and excuse yourself to speak to him. He gives you the reward, just as handsome
	as promised and gives you his word that news will spread that it was you who lead the party that killed the dragon. You were a hero now.</p>
	
	<p> He gives you a pat on the shoulder before disappering amoung the trees once more. You hold the bag of gold in your hand and glance towards the bandits - there's more than enough
	to give them a share and have plenty for yourself - and with the added hero title you're sure that you'd have no problem earning more gold. But on the other hand, you could run away now 
	with the gold, and keep it to yourself. </p>
	
	<p> Do you share or keep the gold?</p>
