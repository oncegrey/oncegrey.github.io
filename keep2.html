	<p>You are now nearing the end of your quest! The dragon’s layer lies at the top of the mountains peak. Do you choose to follow the cave path, known as The Dancing Caverns,  
	dark and perilous?  Or do you choose to follow the winding path that leads up the side of the Nokorich mountain, the cold, strong wind might blow you off?</p>
		

	<p> Do you chose the cave or mountain path?</p>
	
			<div class="overlay" id="overlay" onclick="off()">
		<div class="text">The dragon senses you and your party near! It’s fiery breath spans through the cave and there is no escape – 
			you try your best but you and your comrades fall, defeated by the dragons flames.</p>
